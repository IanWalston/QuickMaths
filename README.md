# QUICK MATHS

***"Two plus two is four, minus one that's three, quick maths" - Big Shaq***

## GWU Winter-Break Homework

A quick game of evaluating expressions involving adding, subtracting, multiplying, and diving a bunch of 1s and 2s together. 

### Why should I get good at "mental math?"

There are lots of reasons you should want to be good at math, other than the obvious ones like having fun and being cool: 

#### Standardized Tests

SAT, ACT, GED, GRE, certificates, other stuff like that. None of them are all mental math, but being able to do those parts flawlessly and quickly really free's up your time to think about the more complicated bits

#### Staving off dementia

Keep your brain sharp by practicing math.

#### Save time in the future

Get good at math to shave seconds off of the millions of situations in the future where you'll be doing short calculations throughout your life. 

#### Impress people

Even though mental math is just a series of cheap tricks, some people think being good at mental math means your smart. Make one wrong move and you'll come across as an idiot, so take the time to become flawless.





My favorite part of this game is that the answers to the expressions are evaluated by javascript and are not hardcoded into the program. This lets me add to the problem set without solving the new problems, as well as blame the eval() function if there are any disagreemenets on what an answer to a problem should have been.
